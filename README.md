# project-decoder-ring

# Context

> * This application takes in a string and converts it to a secret code, it can also take in a secret code string, and decode it to English.

# User: 

> * The intended user is anyone who enjoys sending encoded messages. There are a variety of ways you can code and decode a message, so it's a
fun app to use between friends.

# Use: 

> * This is intended to be used for personal enjoyment, to create encoded messages and decode messages 

# Features: 

> * This features four different ways of encoding and decoding messages, include the Ceasar shift and a Polybius square

# Technologies used: 

> * The front end was designed with HTML5 and CSS, and the back end algorithms were created with Vanilla Javascript and Node.js

# Discoveries: 

> * By the end of this iteration of this project, I discovered the usefulness of array methods for string manipulation. I also discovered
that when I feel overwhelmed by a task, I can solve it by breaking it down into very small steps.

# Future goals for this project: 

> * I intend to clean up the algorithms and make sure each encoder and decoder algorithm is as concise as possible. I may also add some additional
functionality in the form of other codes.

# Screenshots/Images: 

> * coming soon.
